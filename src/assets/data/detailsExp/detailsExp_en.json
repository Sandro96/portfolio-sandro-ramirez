Using .NET for business logic and SQL Server to manage user data, bets, and real-time results, the application allowed employees to make predictions and participate in friendly bets.

        "description": "Provided support and enhancements to the internal system of a Chilean logistics company, developing functionalities and optimizing workflows to increase operational efficiency. My work included creating and managing logistics data tables and implementing them in the system. On the frontend, I worked with Angular and Bootstrap to build responsive components and interactive forms, facilitating order management and shipment tracking in an intuitive manner. On the backend, I used ASP.NET Core following SOLID principles and Clean Architecture to ensure a robust and maintainable structure, developing RESTful services integrated with the frontend and other systems. Using SQL Server, I designed optimized queries and stored procedures for fast data access. Additionally, I followed a repository system for code organization and established a continuous integration and deployment pipeline with Git, TeamCity, and Octopus, ensuring smooth delivery and minimizing production errors. Postman was essential in the testing phase, guaranteeing the quality and performance of the implemented REST services.",
